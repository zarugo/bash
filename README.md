A set of script to manage embedded devices - environment specific

menu.sh = script to set ip address on Raspbian using ifup config. THIS IS DEPRECATED BY RASPBIAN!! They now use dhcpcd to set the network

setup.sh = script to set ip address on Raspbian using dhcpcd, plus a specific config file (jbl-conf) that can be taken off because it's not needed
